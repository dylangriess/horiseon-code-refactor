# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor the code in order to make it more readable and condensed. Many CSS elements were repeated across variables, making it heavily redundant. Class selectors were combined with like elements. Layout and functionality were maintained to ensure the page loaded as intended.
